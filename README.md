This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Convex, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Convex** - Reactive backend-as-a-service platform
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Convex Setup

This project uses Convex as a backend. You'll need to set up Convex before running the app:

```bash
pnpm dev:setup
```

Follow the prompts to create a new Convex project and connect it to your application.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Your app will connect to the Convex cloud backend automatically.
